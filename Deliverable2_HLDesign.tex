\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section

This document will go in depth into the design of Merlin, a song lookup application, using various different analysis methods such as a Use Case Diagram, Analysis Class Diagram, Architectural Design Analysis, as well as Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Cards.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
	The purpose of this documentation is to state, describe and analyze the architecture of the Merlin song identification app. This will be done through a set of predetermined and proven analysis methods and is intended to be read by the implementation team and client. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
	The application, Merlin, contains a back end system that will be discussed in this report. The system is constructed using multiple expert classes and each class will render a different set of code. A user may input the information about a song using the Tempo, Lyric or using the Artists name. The app will then use these experts to find the song that the user is trying to search for from a database of all songs. The user will have their previous search information stored on the device. This application will run on any android application, and will be available for download through the android app store.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
This document has 5 sections including this one. Every section analyzes the architecture of the Merlin application’s system in a different way using either diagrams or words. Following is a breakdown of what each section analyzes: 
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
	\item Use Case Analysis and Diagram: This section will demonstrate all possible ways of the app’s interaction with the user. 
	\item Analysis Class Diagram: This diagram will outline the three different types of classes (boundary, controller or entity) and specify which class falls under which category. This section will also show the different connections between the classes.
	\item Architectural Design Class: This section will overview and justify the reason for designing the application in the chosen way. 
	\item Class Responsibility Collaboration Cards: These cards will show the different classes that make up the song identification app, and their key responsibilities. It will also state which classes each other interact with. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use Case Diagram}

\end{figure}
\begin{description}
	\item[View Previous Searches] The user must be able to review their previous searches. All searches should be saved so that they may be displayed in this list. The data saved should consist of the inputs entered to return the result.
	\item[Get More Song Info] Each song result is linked to more detailed information about the artist and song. The user should have access to this more detailed information on request. This use case cannot be executed unless a song is searched for first.
	\item[Search for Song] The user can search for a song based on the inputs given.
	\item[Input] This use case is a generic use case that is extended by more specific input fields. These fields include Tempo Input, Lyric Input and Artist Input.
	\item[Tempo Input] To input a tempo the user must tap on the screen at the desired tempo. This tempo is converted to a measurement in BPM for searching.
	\item[Lyric Input] To input lyrics users will have the option to type some lyrics into the search field or speak into the device's microphone and translate their voice to text via the speech-to-text functionality. These lyrics are a sequence of words that can be found in the desired song.
	\item[Artist Input] The artist input is the name of the artist that preforms the desired song. To input the artist the user may type the name into the search field or speak into the device's microphone and translate their voice to text via the speech-to-text functionality.
	\item[Consult Experts] Experts will be consulted to attempt to identify the desired song. They will work together to combine their opinions to decide on a song.
	\item[Add/Remove Expert] The administrator may wish to take an expert out of the system or introduce an new expert. In order to do so they must contact the developer who will directly preform the switch.

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section
This section should provide an overview of the overall architectural design of your application. You overall architecture should show the division of the system into subsystems with high cohesion and low coupling.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Identify and explain the overall architecture of your system
	\item Be sure to clearly state the name of the architecture
	\item Provide the reasoning and justification of the choice
	\item Provide a structural architecture diagram showing the relationship among the subsystems (if appropriate)
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Provide a brief description of each subsystem. Be sure to document its purpose and relationship to other subsystems.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

% End Section
	
\section{Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Cards}
\label{sec:class_responsibility_collaboration_crc_cards}
% Begin Section
This section should contain all of your CRC cards.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Provide a CRC Card for each identified class
	\item Please use the format outlined in tutorial, i.e., 
	\begin{table}[ht]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
		\hline 
		 \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Class Name:}} \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Responsibility:} & \textbf{Collaborators:} \\
		\hline
		\vspace{1in} & \\
		\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
\end{enumerate}
% End Section

\appendix
\section{Division of Labour}
\label{sec:division_of_labour}
% Begin Section
Include a Division of Labour sheet which indicates the contributions of each team member. This sheet must be signed by all team members.
% End Section

\newpage
\section*{IMPORTANT NOTES}
\begin{itemize}
%	\item You do \underline{NOT} need to provide a text explanation of each diagram; the diagram should speak for itself
	\item Please document any non-standard notations that you may have used
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Rule of Thumb}: if you feel there is any doubt surrounding the meaning of your notations, document them
	\end{itemize}
	\item Some diagrams may be difficult to fit into one page
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is OK if the text is small but please ensure that it is readable when printed
		\item If you need to break a diagram onto multiple pages, please adopt a system of doing so and thoroughly explain how it can be reconnected from one page to the next; if you are unsure about this, please ask about it
	\end{itemize}
	\item Please submit the latest version of Deliverable 1 with Deliverable 2
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It does not have to be a freshly printed version; the latest marked version is OK
	\end{itemize}
	\item If you do \underline{NOT} have a Division of Labour sheet, your deliverable will \underline{NOT} be marked
\end{itemize}
